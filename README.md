The project aims to build a model that can predict future stock values using historical stock data. 
It will utilize the following Python libraries:

1 yfinance: To fetch historical stock data from Yahoo Finance.
2 pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
3 numpy: For numerical operations on the stock data.
4 scikit-learn (sklearn): To build and evaluate the stock value prediction model, 
  primarily using Linear Regression.
5 datetime: To handle date and time data associated with the stock data.

The project will involve fetching historical stock data, preprocessing and feature engineering, 
splitting the data into training and testing sets, training a Linear Regression model on the training data, 
evaluating the model's performance, and tuning the model if necessary. 
Finally, the trained model will be used to predict future stock values based on new data.
